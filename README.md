# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project involves data analysis and interactive dashboard creation using Microsoft Excel to visualize road accident data. The dashboard provides insights into casualty trends, accident severity, vehicle types, and road conditions to help various policymakers and safety organizations (stake holders) make data-driven decisions.
# Road Accident Data Analysis –Interactive Dashboard Created using Ms Excel 
## Project Objectives
Primary KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): Total Casualties after accidents, Casualty Percentage based on accident severity, Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type.
Secondary KPIs:Total Casualties by Vehicle Type, Monthly Trend Comparison (Current Year vs. Previous Year), Maximum Casualties by Road Type, Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface, Relation Between Casualties by Area (Urban/Rural) & Time (Day/Night).

ahttps://github.com/Dhemi-analyst/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20accident%20Dash%20board.xlsx
Format: Excel/CSV
## Analysis Questions (KPIs)
1.	What is the total number of casualties, and how are they distributed by accident severity?
2.	Which vehicle type contributes most to casualties?
3.	How do casualties compare month-wise between the current and previous year?
4.	Which road type has the highest accident casualties?
5.	How do road surface conditions impact accident casualties?
6.	Are accidents more frequent in urban or rural areas during day vs. night?
## Process
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
•	Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate entries.
•	Missing Values: Checked for and handled missing data.
•	Data Formatting: Ensured consistency in data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
2. Pivot Tables & Data Analysis
•	Created Pivot Tables to summarize:
o	Total casualties by severity, vehicle type, and road type.
o	Monthly trends (Year to Year comparison).
o	Casualty distribution by road surface and location.
3. Interactive Dashboard Creation
•	Visualizations Used:
o	Bar Charts (Casualties by vehicle type, road type).
o	Line Charts (Monthly trend comparison).
o	Pie Charts (Severity distribution).
o	Slicers (Dynamic filtering by year, vehicle type, location).
## Data Insights
1.	Accident Severity: 1.7% of accidents were fatal, 14.2% were serious while 84.1% were minor. 
2.	Vehicle Impact: Cars, Trucks and Motorcycle contributed the most to casualties.
3.	Monthly Trend: Casualties peaked in July October and November this could be due to holiday travel. The year 2021 had a slightly higher casualties trend compared to 2022
4.	Road Type: The single Carriage way had the highest accident rates.
5.	Surface Impact: Dry Road contributed most of the casualties (over-speeding likely factor) when compared to wet and snow/ice surface (probably due to limited mobility)
6.	 Time & Location: urban area had more accidents casualties compared to Rural location and during day light(day) there were more casualties to Dark (Night)
## Conclusion
This data-driven analysis reveals critical patterns in road accidents, enabling stakeholders to prioritize safety interventions effectively. 
Key takeaways:
1. High-Risk Scenarios: Urban single carriageways during daylight (peaking July/Oct/Nov) demand targeted measures like speed enforcement.
2. Vehicle Focus: Cars, trucks, and motorcycles require tailored safety campaigns.
3. Severity Gap: While 84% accidents are minor, the 1.7% fatal cases need urgent attention (e.g., improved emergency response).
p/ Dashboard Value: The interactive Excel tool empowers policymakers to:
✔  Allocate resources to high-risk areas/periods.
✔  Design evidence-based road safety policies.
✔  Monitor year-over-year progress via dynamic filters.
